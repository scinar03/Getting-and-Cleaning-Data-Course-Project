### Study Overview:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers
within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six
activities (WALKING, WALKING\_UPSTAIRS, WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING,
STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the
waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured
3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant
rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data
manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two
sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the
training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by
applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows
of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor
acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components,
was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration
and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low
frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency
was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by
calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See
'features\_info.txt' for more details.

### Original Record Overview:

**For each record it is provided:**

-   Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration)
    and the estimated body acceleration.
-   Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
-   A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
-   Its activity label.
-   An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### The R Project Overview:

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect,
work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that
can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a
series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required
to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github
repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code
book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or
work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You
should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo
explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is
wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like
Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced
algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course
website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the
Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site
where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

### R Script Overview:

**The R script accomplishes the following tasks using the original
data**

-   Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
-   Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
    for each measurement.
-   Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data
    set
-   Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
-   From the data set produced by the above transformations, creates a
    second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable
    for each activity and each subject.

### Files Included:

-   **Cleaning\_Data\_Course\_Project.R** - the R script with all data
    transformations and processing.
-   **Code Book.Rdm** - indicates all the variables and summaries
    calculated, along with units, and some other relevant information.
-   **README.Rdm** - explains the study context, analysis files, and the
    script.
-   **mean\_results.txt** - the tidy dataset with the final grouped
    results
